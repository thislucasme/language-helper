# Language Learning Bot

This project is a language learning bot designed to assist users in improving their language skills. The bot utilizes advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including cosine similarity, to provide personalized and efficient language learning experiences.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and medium deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Project Description

This project is a bot designed to assist in language learning. It provides a unique and interactive way to enhance your language skills using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The bot leverages cosine similarity to compare the similarity between different sentences, allowing it to provide relevant and contextually appropriate responses. This feature is particularly useful in language learning, as it helps users understand and practice language in a more natural and engaging manner.

## Features

- **Interactive Learning:** Engage with the bot to practice and improve your language skills in real-time.
- **Cosine Similarity:** Utilizes cosine similarity to provide contextually relevant responses, enhancing the learning experience.
- **Personalized Experience:** Adapts to your learning pace and provides customized feedback.
- **Multi-Language Support:** Supports learning in multiple languages, making it a versatile tool for learners of various languages.
